# :robot: TSM Scripts
Here will we create and maintain all our scripts that could be useful on a Spectrum Protect Server.

## Recommendation
For even more fun scripts we at IssTech recommend to look at [Thobias SQL Script](https://github.com/thobiast/tsm_sql)

## :scroll: License
Feel free to use our scripts and help us to get better, but for License questions are we following the [GNU 3.0](./LICENSE)
